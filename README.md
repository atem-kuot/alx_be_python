# üêç ALX Backend Python Projects

This repository contains foundational Python scripts and modules built as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It demonstrates practical understanding of Python programming across multiple core areas: control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, and programming paradigms.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized by topic, each folder representing a distinct phase of the Python learning journey:

### 1. [`python_introduction/`](./python_introduction/)
Beginner-friendly scripts to get familiar with basic syntax, arithmetic operations, and input/output handling.

- [`basic_operations.py`](./python_introduction/basic_operations.py) ‚Äì Performs basic math and prints results  
- [`finance_calculator.py`](./python_introduction/finance_calculator.py) ‚Äì A simple finance-related computation tool

### 2. [`control-flow/`](./control-flow/)
Programs illustrating conditional logic, loops, and pattern matching.

- [`match_case_calculator.py`](./control-flow/match_case_calculator.py) ‚Äì Calculator using Python‚Äôs `match-case` structure  
- [`pattern_drawing.py`](./control-flow/pattern_drawing.py) ‚Äì Draws text-based patterns using loops  
- [`weather_advice.py`](./control-flow/weather_advice.py) ‚Äì Gives weather suggestions based on conditions  
- [`multiplication_table.py`](./control-flow/multiplication_table.py), [`daily_reminder.py`](./control-flow/daily_reminder.py)

### 3. [`fns_and_dsa/`](./fns_and_dsa/)
Explores functions, modularity, and simple algorithmic structures.

- [`arithmetic_operations.py`](./fns_and_dsa/arithmetic_operations.py) ‚Äì Custom arithmetic using functions  
- [`shopping_list_manager.py`](./fns_and_dsa/shopping_list_manager.py) ‚Äì Command-line shopping list handler  
- [`temp_conversion_tool.py`](./fns_and_dsa/temp_conversion_tool.py) ‚Äì Converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit  
- [`explore_datetime.py`](./fns_and_dsa/explore_datetime.py) ‚Äì Handles dates and times

### 4. [`oop/`](./oop/)
Covers object-oriented principles such as classes, static/class methods, and polymorphism.

- [`book_class.py`](./oop/book_class.py), [`library_system.py`](./oop/library_system.py)  
- [`class_static_methods_demo.py`](./oop/class_static_methods_demo.py) ‚Äì Demonstrates the use of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`  
- [`polymorphism_demo.py`](./oop/polymorphism_demo.py) ‚Äì Example of polymorphism

### 5. [`programming_paradigm/`](./programming_paradigm/)
Focuses on applying different paradigms (procedural, functional, OOP) in real-world scripts.

- [`bank_account.py`](./programming_paradigm/bank_account.py), [`library_management.py`](./programming_paradigm/library_management.py)  
- [`robust_division_calculator.py`](./programming_paradigm/robust_division_calculator.py) ‚Äì Exception-safe division logic  
- [`test_simple_calculator.py`](./programming_paradigm/test_simple_calculator.py) ‚Äì Includes basic unit testing
